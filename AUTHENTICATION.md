# Authentication Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of Google authentication in the AI Interview Assistant application using Firebase.

## Overview

The application uses Firebase Authentication to provide a secure and user-friendly sign-in experience. Users can sign in with their Google accounts, and their authentication state is managed throughout the application.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Firebase Configuration (`src/services/firebase.ts`)

- Initializes Firebase with configuration from environment variables
- Provides functions for:
  - `signInWithGoogle()`: Handles Google sign-in using a popup
  - `signOut()`: Handles user sign-out
  - `getCurrentUser()`: Returns the current authenticated user
  - `onAuthStateChange()`: Sets up a listener for authentication state changes

### 2. Authentication Hook (`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`)

- Custom React hook that manages authentication state
- Provides:
  - `user`: The current authenticated user (or null if not authenticated)
  - `loading`: Loading state during authentication operations
  - `error`: Error state for authentication operations
  - `signIn()`: Function to trigger Google sign-in
  - `logOut()`: Function to trigger sign-out

### 3. Login Page (`src/components/LoginPage.tsx`)

- Renders a clean, user-friendly login interface
- Displays a Google sign-in button
- Shows loading state during authentication
- Displays error messages if authentication fails

### 4. User Profile Component (`src/components/UserProfile.tsx`)

- Displays the authenticated user's information (name and profile picture)
- Provides a sign-out button

### 5. Authentication Flow in App (`src/App.tsx`)

- Conditionally renders the login page or main application based on authentication state
- Shows a loading spinner while authentication state is being determined
- Protects the main application features behind authentication

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for Firebase authentication:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

## Security Considerations

1. Firebase authentication is handled securely through Google's infrastructure
2. The application uses environment variables to store sensitive configuration
3. Authentication state is properly managed to prevent unauthorized access to the application
4. The Firebase configuration includes fallback values but should be properly configured in production

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the authentication system could include:

1. Support for additional authentication providers (GitHub, email/password, etc.)
2. User profile management (updating profile information)
3. Role-based access control for different features
4. Email verification for non-Google authentication methods
5. Password reset functionality for email/password authentication
